      <h2>What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?</h2>
      To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide
      and improve Ema-john Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. For
      more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our
      Cookies Notice.

      <h2>Does Ema-john Share Your Personal Information?</h2>
      Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and
      we are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information
      to others. We share customers' personal information only as described
      below and with subsidiaries Ema-john.com, Inc. controls that either are
      subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective
      as those described in this Privacy Notice.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h6>Transactions involving Third Parties:</h6> We make available to you
      services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for
      use on or through Ema-john Services. For example, you can order products
      from third parties through our stores, download applications from
      third-party application providers from our App Store, and enable
      third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or
      sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as co-branded
      credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your
      transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to
      those transactions with that third party.
      <h6>Third-Party Service Providers:</h6> We employ other companies and
      individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
      fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending
      postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer
      lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search
      results and links (including paid listings and links), processing
      payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit
      risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers
      have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but
      may not use it for other purposes.
      <h6>Business Transfers:</h6> As we continue to develop our business, we
      might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions,
      customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets
      but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
      Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the
      unlikely event that Ema-john.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets
      are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the
      transferred assets. Protection of Ema-john and Others: We release account
      and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
      comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other
      agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Ema-john, our
      users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other
      companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
      reduction. Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when
      personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you
      will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h2>
      We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We work to
      protect the security of your personal information during transmission by
      using encryption protocols and software. We follow the Payment Card
      Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.
      We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection
      with the collection, storage, and disclosure of customer personal
      information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask to verify your
      identity before we disclose personal information to you. Our devices offer
      security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of
      data. You can control these features and configure them based on your
      needs. Click here for more information on how to manage the security
      settings of your device. It is important for you to protect against
      unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and
      applications. We recommend using a unique password for your Ema-john
      account that is not used for other online accounts. Be sure to sign off
      when finished using a shared computer. Click here for more information on
      how to sign off.

      <h2>What About Advertising?</h2>
      Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites: Ema-john Services may
      include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps.
      Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when
      you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more
      information about third-party advertising at Ema-john, including
      interest-based ads, please read our Interest-Based Ads notice. To adjust
      your advertising preferences, please go to the Advertising Preferences
      page. Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: We provide ad companies
      with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and
      relevant Ema-john ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share
      your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do
      this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other
      device identifier. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our
      apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event
      so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad
      companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other
      advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based
      advertising by going to the Advertising Preferences page. What Information
      Can I Access? You can access your information, including your name,
      address, payment options, profile information, Prime membership, household
      settings, and purchase history in the "Your Account" section of the
      website. Click here for a list of examples that you can access.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>What Choices Do I Have?</h2>
      If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal
      information, please contact our Customer Service. Many of our Ema-john
      Services also include settings that provide you with options as to how
      your information is being used. As described above, you can choose not to
      provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take
      advantage of many of the Ema-john Services. You can add or update certain
      information on pages such as those referenced in What Information Can I
      Access?. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior
      version for our records. If you do not want to receive email or other
      communications from us, please adjust your Customer Communication
      Preferences. If you don't want to receive in-app notifications from us,
      please adjust your notification settings in the app or device. If you do
      not want to see interest-based ads, please adjust your Advertising
      Preferences. The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you
      how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other
      identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new
      cookie, or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies and
      identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of
      Ema-john Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For
      instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be
      able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any
      Services that require you to Sign in. For more information about cookies
      and other identifiers, see our Cookies Notice. If you want to browse our
      websites without linking the browsing history to your account, you may do
      so by logging out of your account here and blocking cookies on your
      browser. You can manage the recommendations you receive in our store here,
      remove recommendations you donâ€™t want to see here by selecting View All
      and Manage then selecting the Remove Items toggle that appears at the top
      of the page, and edit your browsing history here. You will also be able to
      opt out of certain other types of data usage by updating your settings on
      the applicable Ema-john website (e.g., in "Manage Your Content and
      Devices"), device, or application. For more information click here. Most
      non-Ema-john devices also provide users with the ability to change device
      permissions (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most
      devices, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you
      have questions about how to change your device permissions on devices
      manufactured by third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile
      service carrier or your device manufacturer. If you are a seller, you can
      add or update certain information in Seller Central, update your account
      information by accessing your Seller Account Information, and adjust your
      email or other communications you receive from us by updating your
      Notification Preferences. If you are an author, you can add or update the
      information you have provided in the Author Portal and Author Central by
      accessing your accounts in the Author Portal and Author Central,
      respectively. In addition, to the extent required by applicable law, you
      may have the right to request access to or delete your personal
      information. If you wish to do any of these things, please contact
      Customer Service. Depending on your data choices, certain services may be
      limited or unavailable.
